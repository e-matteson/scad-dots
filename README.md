# Scad Dots

This library lets you build simple 3d models by "connecting the dots", and outputs them as OpenSCAD code.

It is still in development, not fully-documented, and generally not ready for serious use.

## Requirements

* Linux 
* To view the outputted openSCAD files, you will need to install (openSCAD)[TODO link].

## Plans

* Finish documenting the API
* Write a high-level guide, with figures
* Support cross-platform model viewing
* Generalize the test harness
