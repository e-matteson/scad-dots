# Scad Dots

This library lets you build simple 3d models by "connecting the dots", and outputs them as OpenSCAD code.

It is still in development, not fully-documented, and not quite ready for use.

## Requirements

* Linux (for now)
* To view the outputted OpenSCAD files, you will need to install [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/).

## Projects using `scad-dots`

* [lapstrake](https://github.com/e-matteson/lapstrake)

## Plans

* Finish documenting the API
* Write a high-level guide, with figures
* Remove linux dependency for model-viewing
* Generalize the test harness
